How I Became a Senior Penetration Tester in Financial Services — Without a Formal Degree
People often ask how I ended up performing PCI DSS and ISO 27001 penetration tests for major financial institutions without a university degree. How did I get into a senior role in offensive security? And how do I actually make a living from hacking?

From Curiosity to Commitment
During one summer, I decided to commit fully to becoming a penetration tester. I consumed every piece of information I could find — technical papers, malware analyses (especially Alice and Ploutus), and security research on Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
I studied day and night, diving into vulnerability exploitation, red teaming methodologies, and the academic side of cybersecurity. Like a medical student exploring every specialization, I wanted to understand everything.
Ethics, Opportunity, and Practice
At first, I was drawn to the most complex technical challenges — finding vulnerabilities, breaking defenses, and learning from the process. Some colleagues encouraged me to lean into social engineering because I had a natural talent for it, but I’ve always felt more at home exploiting systems, not people.
To improve, I practiced constantly:

Daily challenges on CTFs and Offensive Security labs.

Contributions to OWASP NetTacker and creating my own repositories.

Studying the cryptography, jailbreaking, and exploit development that underpins both cyberattacks and defense.

Like most in this field, I faced impostor syndrome. I made far more mistakes than successes — but each failure was a lesson. Over time, I realized that true expertise in cybersecurity is about persistence and continuous learning. Anyone who says they know everything in this field probably hasn’t opened Google Scholar or read a new CVE in a while.
The Breakthrough
My opportunity came faster than expected. Despite having no formal degree, I was hired as the sole offensive security engineer in a financial-sector company of national renown.
My first assignment?
A penetration test on an institutional website under active attack.
The second?
A PCI DSS engagement.
The third?
A cloud and web application test under the ISO 27001 framework.
From there, the list kept growing — AWS configurations, phishing simulations, and red team operations.
Real-World Lessons
One of my most impactful experiences was co-leading a corporate phishing campaign for a company that had previously suffered a ransomware attack. With careful planning — crafting realistic, urgent, and context-aware messages — we achieved over a 50% engagement rate. It was a stark reminder that technical defenses are only part of the battle.
Another defining moment came when a respected mentor — a former immigration officer turned security professional — approached me at a conference. After a brief conversation (and a demonstration of my ATM security research), he offered me a position that changed my career trajectory.
That role introduced me to enterprise-grade tools like Nessus Professional and Burp Suite Pro, and gave me access to a level of infrastructure and mentorship I’d only dreamed of. It was the perfect mix of preparation meeting opportunity.
Reflections on the Journey
Looking back, I see that my success wasn’t luck — it was preparation, patience, and passion.
Cybersecurity rewards curiosity and perseverance more than credentials.
The financial stability and flexibility that come with this career are great, but what matters most is the impact: helping protect organizations and people from cybercrime.
Even if security teams are sometimes seen as the “strict ones” in a company, the satisfaction of preventing real-world damage outweighs everything.
Today, I focus on cloud, AWS, and web security, while still nurturing my passion for red teaming and offensive research. I continue to study every day, because in cybersecurity, the moment you stop learning is the moment you fall behind.
Who knows — maybe someday I’ll be that hacker who walks into a company with a backpack full of tools, helping make the internet just a bit safer, one client at a time.
